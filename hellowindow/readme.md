project: Hello window
#Note
1.Be sure to include GLAD before GLFW. The include file for GLAD includes the required OpenGL headers behind the scenes (like GL/gl.h) so be sure to include GLAD before other header files that require OpenGL (like GLFW).
2.To find the OpenGL version on your machine either call glxinfo on Linux machines or use a utility like the OpenGL Extension Viewer for Windows.

2:Double buffer
When an application draws in a single buffer the resulting image may display flickering issues. This is because the resulting output image is not drawn in an instant, but drawn pixel by pixel and usually from left to right and top to bottom. Because this image is not displayed at an instant to the user while still being rendered to, the result may contain artifacts. To circumvent these issues, windowing applications apply a double buffer for rendering. The front buffer contains the final output image that is shown at the screen, while all the rendering commands draw to the back buffer. As soon as all the rendering commands are finished we swap the back buffer to the front buffer so the image can be displayed without still being rendered to, removing all the aforementioned artifacts.
