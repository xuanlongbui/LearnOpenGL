1. A texture: is a 2D image (even 1D and 3D textures exist) used to add detail to an object.
2. Texture coordinates range:  from 0 to 1 in the x and y axis (remember that we use 2D texture images). 
3. Sampling: Retrieving the texture color using texture coordinates.
4. Texture Wrapping: 
    - GL_REPEAT: The default behavior for textures. Repeats the texture image.( basically ignore the integer part of the floating point texture coordinate)
    - GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT: Same as GL_REPEAT but mirrors the image with each repeat.
    - GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: Clamps the coordinates between 0 and 1. The result is that higher coordinates become clamped to the edge, resulting in a stretched edge pattern.
    - GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER: Coordinates outside the range are now given a user-specified border color.glTexParameterfv to specify a border color
   Each of the aforementioned options can be set per coordinate axis (s, t (and r if you're using 3D textures) equivalent to x,y,z) with the glTexParameter* function 
5. Texture Filtering:
    -texel: texture pixel
    -GL_NEAREST : (default )  selects the texel that center is closest to the texture coordinate.
    -GL_LINEAR : an interpolated value from the texture coordinate's neighboring texels, approximating a color between the texels.
    Texture filtering can be set for magnifying and minifying operations 
6. mipmaps: a collection of texture images where each subsequent texture is twice as small compared to the previous one.
 Appling for case objects far away that have the same high resolution texture attached as the objects close to the viewer.
 Texture magnification doesn't use mipmaps.

7.The main purpose of texture units: is to allow us to use more than 1 texture in our shaders.
